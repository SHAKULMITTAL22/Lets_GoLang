/*
 1. Scenario: Test when the number is less than 3
    Expected: It should print "None" for each number as none are divisible by 3 or 5.

 2. Scenario: Test when the number is greater than 3 but less than 5.
    Expected: It should print "Fizz" for every number divisible by 3, and "None" for the rest.

 3. Scenario: Test when the number is 5.
    Expected: It should print "Fizz" for multiples of 3, "Buzz" for 5 and "None" for the rest.

 4. Scenario: Test when the number is greater than or equal to 15.
    Expected: It should print "Fizz" for multiples of 3, "Buzz" for multiples of 5, "FizzBuzz" for multiples of 15 and "None" for the rest.

 5. Scenario: Test when the number is equal to 0.
    Expected: No output as the loop will not run.

 6. Scenario: Test when the number is negative.
    Expected: No output as the number is less than 0 and the loop will not run.

 7. Scenario: Test when the number is a very large integer.
    Expected: The function should handle the integer and output the correct value, this will test the function's ability to handle large numbers.

 8. Scenario: Test when the number is equal to a multiple of 3.
    Expected: The function should output "Fizz" for all multiples of 3.

 9. Scenario: Test when the number is equal to a multiple of 5.
    Expected: The function should output "Buzz" for all multiples of 5.

 10. Scenario: Test when the number is equal to a multiple of both 3 and 5.
    Expected: The function should output "FizzBuzz" for all multiples of 15.
