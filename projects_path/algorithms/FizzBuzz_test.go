 Scenario 1: Test FizzBuzz output

Details:
The test is meant to check if the function correctly prints "FizzBuzz" when the number is divisible by both 3 and 5.

Execution:
Arrange: Set up the number variable to a value that is divisible by both 3 and 5, e.g. 15
Act: Invoke the fizz_buzz function with the number variable
Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function prints "FizzBuzz" followed by the corresponding number

Validation:
The choice of assertion is to check the output of the function for the specific FizzBuzz case. By setting the expected output, we validate the correct calculation inside the function. This test is important because it demonstrates the expected combined behavior of Fizz and Buzz for the given input.

Scenario 2: Test Fizz output

Details:
The test is meant to check if the function correctly prints "Fizz" when the number is divisible by 3.

Execution:
Arrange: Set up the number variable to a value that is divisible by 3, e.g. 9
Act: Invoke the fizz_buzz function with the number variable
Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function prints "Fizz" followed by the corresponding number

Validation:
The choice of assertion is to check the output of the function for the specific Fizz case. By setting the expected output, we validate the correct calculation inside the function. This test is important because it ensures the expected Fizz behavior for the given input.

Scenario 3: Test Buzz output

Details:
The test is meant to check if the function correctly prints "Buzz" when the number is divisible by 5.

Execution:
Arrange: Set up the number variable to a value that is divisible by 5, e.g. 10
Act: Invoke the fizz_buzz function with the number variable
Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function prints "Buzz" followed by the corresponding number

Validation:
The choice of assertion is to check the output of the function for the specific Buzz case. By setting the expected output, we validate the correct calculation inside the function. This test is important because it ensures the expected Buzz behavior for the given input.

Scenario 4: Test None output

Details:
The test is meant to check if the function correctly prints "None" when the number is not divisible by 3 or 5.

Execution:
Arrange: Set up the number variable to a value that is not divisible by 3 or 5, e.g. 7
Act: Invoke the fizz_buzz function with the number variable
Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function prints "None" followed by the corresponding number

Validation:
The choice of assertion is to check the output of the function for the specific None case. By setting the expected output, we validate the correct calculation inside the function. This test is important because it ensures the default behavior for the given input.

Scenario 5: Test FizzBuzz edge case

Details:
The test is meant to check if the function correctly prints "FizzBuzz" for the smallest possible number divisible by both 3 and 5, i.e. 15.

Execution:
Arrange: Set up the number variable to the value 15
Act: Invoke the fizz_buzz function with the number variable
Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function prints "FizzBuzz" followed by the number

Validation:
The choice of assertion is to check the output of the function for the specific FizzBuzz case. By setting the expected output, we validate the correct calculation inside the function. This test is important because it ensures the expected behavior for the smallest possible FizzBuzz input.

Scenario 6: Test Fizz edge case

Details:
The test is meant to check if the function correctly prints "Fizz" for the smallest possible number divisible by 3, i.e. 3.

Execution:
Arrange: Set up the number variable to the value 3
Act: Invoke the fizz_buzz function with the number variable
Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function prints "Fizz" followed by the number

Validation:
The choice of assertion is to check the output of the function for the specific Fizz case. By setting the expected output, we validate the correct calculation inside the function. This test is important because it ensures the expected behavior for the smallest possible Fizz input.

Scenario 7: Test Buzz edge case

Details:
The test is meant to check if the function correctly prints "Buzz" for the smallest possible number divisible by 5, i.e. 5.

Execution:
Arrange: Set up the number variable to the value 5
Act: Invoke the fizz_buzz function with the number variable
Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function prints "Buzz" followed by the number

Validation:
The choice of assertion is to check the output of the function for the specific Buzz case. By setting the expected output, we validate the correct calculation inside the function. This test is important because it ensures the expected behavior for the smallest possible Buzz input.

Scenario 8: Test None edge case

Details:
The test is meant to check if the function correctly prints "None" for the smallest possible number that is not divisible by 3 or 5, i.e. 1.

Execution:
Arrange: Set up the number variable to the value 1
Act: Invoke the fizz_buzz function with the number variable
Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function prints "None" followed by the number

Validation:
The choice of assertion is to check the output of the function for the specific None case. By setting the expected output, we validate the correct calculation inside the function. This test is important because it ensures the expected behavior for the smallest possible None input.
