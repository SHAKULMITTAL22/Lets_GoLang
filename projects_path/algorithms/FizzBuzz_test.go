ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=fizz_buzz_18fb1c9776

### Scenario 1: Positive Number Input
Details:
  Description: Test the function with a positive integer to ensure it prints the correct sequence of "Fizz", "Buzz", "FizzBuzz", or "None" for each number up to the input number minus one.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement since the function does not modify or depend on external data.
  Act: Call `fizz_buzz` with a positive integer, for example, 15.
  Assert: Capture the output of the function and verify that it contains the correct sequence of "Fizz", "Buzz", "FizzBuzz", and "None" corresponding to the rules defined in the function.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is to check the output sequence against a predefined string of expected results. This test confirms that the function behaves correctly under normal circumstances and adheres to the FizzBuzz logic, which is crucial for verifying the basic logic of the function.

### Scenario 2: Zero as Input
Details:
  Description: Test the function with zero as input to ensure that it handles this edge case without output.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement needed.
  Act: Call `fizz_buzz` with 0 as the parameter.
  Assert: Ensure that no output is produced by the function.
Validation:
  Asserting no output verifies that the function correctly handles the case where the loop does not initiate, as expected when the input is zero. This test is important to ensure that the function gracefully handles lower boundary conditions.

### Scenario 3: Negative Number Input
Details:
  Description: Test how the function behaves when given a negative integer, which is technically an invalid scenario for this function.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement needed.
  Act: Call `fizz_buzz` with a negative integer, for example, -1.
  Assert: Ensure that no output is produced by the function.
Validation:
  Checking for no output in the case of negative input tests the function's robustness and its ability to handle unexpected or out-of-bounds input values. This scenario is crucial for ensuring that the function does not behave erratically or produce erroneous output when faced with invalid input.

### Scenario 4: Large Number Input
Details:
  Description: Test the function with a very large number to evaluate its performance and ensure it still outputs correctly under stress.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement needed.
  Act: Call `fizz_buzz` with a large number, such as 10000.
  Assert: Verify that the function completes execution without errors and in a reasonable amount of time.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's performance and scalability. By asserting that the function handles large inputs efficiently and correctly, we ensure that the implementation is robust and can handle high-volume scenarios.

### Scenario 5: Input of One
Details:
  Description: Test the function with an input of 1 to verify that it correctly handles this minimal non-zero, positive input.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement needed.
  Act: Call `fizz_buzz` with 1 as the input.
  Assert: Ensure that the output is "None" for 0 since it is neither divisible by 3 nor by 5.
Validation:
  Asserting that the output is "None" confirms that the function handles single-digit inputs correctly and adheres to the FizzBuzz rules even at the smallest level. This test is essential for verifying correct behavior in minimal positive input scenarios.
