ROOST_METHOD_HASH=fizz_buzz_5a73955db0
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=fizz_buzz_18fb1c9776

 Scenario 1: Successful Call with Valid Input

Details:

* The test input is expected to be a positive integer, and the output should correspond to the correct behavior of the fizz_buzz function.
* An example of a valid input could be 15, expecting the output to be: "FizzBuzz 1".

Execution:

* Arrange: Create an instance of the `main.fizz_buzz()` with an input of 15.
* Act: Invoke the `fizz_buzz()` function with the input of 15.
* Assert: Verify that the output is "FizzBuzz 1".

Validation:

* The expected output is "FizzBuzz 1" according to the functionality of the `fizz_buzz()` function. 
* This test case ensures the core functionality of the fizz_buzz function is working correctly.

Scenario 2: Valid Input with Required Buzz Behavior

Details:

* The input should be a multiple of 5 with no presence of 3, or a multiple of 3 with no presence of 5. 
* An example of such an input could be 10, expecting the output to be "Buzz 10".

Execution:

* Arrange: Create an instance of the `main.fizz_buzz()` with an input of 10.
* Act: Invoke the `fizz_buzz()` function with the input of 10.
* Assert: Verify that the output is "Buzz 10".

Validation:

* The expected output is "Buzz 10" according to the functionality of the fizz_buzz function when the input is a multiple of 5 with no presence of 3. 
* This test case ensures that the fizz_buzz function handles the specified edge case correctly.

Scenario 3: Valid Input with Required Fizz Behavior

Details:

* The input should be a multiple of 3 with no presence of 5, or a multiple of 5 with no presence of 3. 
* An example of such an input could be 12, expecting the output to be "Fizz 12".

Execution:

* Arrange: Create an instance of the `main.fizz_buzz()` with an input of 12.
* Act: Invoke the `fizz_buzz()` function with the input of 12.
* Assert: Verify that the output is "Fizz 12".

Validation:

* The expected output is "Fizz 12" according to the functionality of the fizz_buzz function when the input is a multiple of 3 with no presence of 5. 
* This test case ensures that the fizz_buzz function handles the specified edge case correctly.

Scenario 4: Invalid Input - Going Below 1

Details:

* The input should be less than 1, which the function is not designed to handle. 
* An example of such an input could be 0, expecting the output to be "None", or a negative number, expecting the output to be "None".

Execution:

* Arrange: Create an instance of the `main.fizz_buzz()` with input less than 1.
* Act: Invoke the `fizz_buzz()` function with the input less than 1.
* Assert: Verify that the output is "None".

Validation:

* This test case ensures that the fizz_buzz function handles invalid inputs correctly by returning "None". It helps to find any input validation issues.

Scenario 5: Invalid Input - Going Above Maximum Integer Range

Details:

* The input should be above the maximum integer range for Go's default integer type (int), which should result in a run-time error.
* An example of such an input could be 2,147,483,647, expecting the output to be a run-time error.

Execution:

* Arrange: Create an instance of the `main.fizz_
