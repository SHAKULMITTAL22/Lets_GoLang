ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=fizz_buzz_18fb1c9776

 Scenario 1: Test fizz_buzz with a positive number less than 15

Details:
This test is meant to check if the function correctly identifies numbers divisible by 3 and/or 5 when provided a positive number less than 15.

Execution:
Arrange: Set up the fizz_buzz function with a number less than 15, e.g., 14
Act: Invoke the fizz_buzz function with the set up number
Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual results match the expected outcomes

Expected Output:
0: None
1: None
2: None
3: Fizz 
4: Buzz
5: Fizz
6: Fizz
7: None
8: None
9: Fizz
10: Buzz
11: Fizz
12: Fizz
13: None

Validation:
In this scenario, we expect the function to return the correct Fizz and Buzz outputs when given a positive number less than 15. We assert the outputs to ensure consistency and accuracy in the function's behavior. This test is important to verify that the function works as expected with normal inputs.

Scenario 2: Test fizz_buzz with a positive number greater than 15

Details:
This test is meant to check if the function correctly identifies numbers divisible by 3 and/or 5 when provided a positive number greater than 15.

Execution:
Arrange: Set up the fizz_buzz function with a number greater than 15, e.g., 30
Act: Invoke the fizz_buzz function with the set up number
Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual results match the expected outcomes

Expected Output:
0: None
1: None
2: None
3: Fizz
4: Buzz
5: Fizz
6: Fizz
7: None
8: None
9: Fizz
10: Buzz
11: Fizz
12: Fizz
13: None
14: None
15: FizzBuzz
16: None
17: None
18: Fizz
19: None
20: Buzz
21: Fizz
22: None
23: None
24: Fizz
25: None
26: Fizz
27: Fizz
28: None
29: None

Validation:
In this scenario, we expect the function to return the correct Fizz, Buzz, and FizzBuzz outputs when given a positive number greater than 15. We assert the outputs to ensure consistency and accuracy in the function's behavior. This test is important to verify that the function works as expected with normal inputs.

---

Scenario 3: Test fizz_buzz with a zero input

Details:
This test is meant to check if the function behaves as expected when given a zero input.

Execution:
Arrange: Set up the fizz_buzz function with a zero input
Act: Invoke the fizz_buzz function with the set up number
Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual results match the expected outcomes

Expected Output:
0: None

Validation:
In this scenario, we expect the function to return 'None' once when given a zero input. We assert the output to ensure consistency and accuracy in the function's behavior. This test is important to verify that the function handles edge cases correctly.

---

Scenario 4: Test fizz_buzz with a negative number

Details:
This test is meant to check if the function behaves as expected when given a negative number.

Execution:
Arrange: Set up the fizz_buzz function with a negative number, e.g., -10
Act: Invoke the fizz_buzz function with the set up number
Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual results match the expected outcomes

Expected Output:
-10: None
-9: Fizz
-8: None
-7: None
-6: Fizz
-5: Buzz
-4: None
-3: Fizz
-2: None
-1: None

Validation:
In this scenario, we expect the function to return the correct Fizz, Buzz outputs when given a negative number. We assert the outputs to ensure consistency and accuracy in the function's behavior. This test is important to verify that the function handles edge cases correctly.

---

Scenario 5: Test fizz_buzz with large numbers close to INT_MAX

Details:
This test is meant to check if the function behaves as expected when given a large positive number close to the maximum value of an integer.

Execution:
Arrange: Set up the fizz_buzz function with a large positive number, e.g., (INT_MAX - 20)
Act: Invoke the fizz_buzz function with the set up number
Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual results match the expected outcomes

Expected Output:
(INT_MAX - 20) consecutive 'None' strings

Validation:
In this scenario, we expect the function to return 'None' for all inputs when given a large positive number close to the maximum value of an integer. We assert the outputs to ensure consistency and accuracy in the function's behavior. This test is important to verify that the function handles edge cases correctly.

---

Scenario 6: Test fizz_buzz with the INT_MAX value

Details:
This test is meant to check if the function behaves as expected when given the maximum value of an integer (INT_MAX).

Execution:
Arrange: Set up the fizz_buzz function with the maximum value of an integer, e.g., INT_MAX
Act: Invoke the fizz_buzz function with the set up number
Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual results match the expected outcomes

Expected Output:
0 'None' strings

Validation:
In this scenario, we expect the function to return no output when given the maximum value of an integer (INT_MAX). We assert the outputs to ensure consistency and accuracy in the function's behavior. This test is important to verify that the function handles edge cases correctly.

---

Scenario 7: Test fizz_buzz with a large negative number close to INT_MIN

Details:
This test is meant to check if the function behaves as expected when given a large negative number close to the minimum value of an integer.

Execution:
Arrange: Set up the fizz_buzz function with a large negative number, e.g., (INT_MIN + 20)
Act: Invoke the fizz_buzz function with the set up number
Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual results match the expected outcomes

Expected Output:
(INT_MIN + 20) consecutive 'None' strings

Validation:
In this scenario, we expect the function to return no output when given a large negative number close to the minimum value of an integer. We assert the outputs to ensure consistency and accuracy in the function's behavior. This test is important to verify that the function handles edge cases correctly.

---

Scenario 8: Test fizz_buzz with the minimum value of an integer (INT_MIN)

Details:
This test is meant to check if the function behaves as expected when given the minimum value of an integer (INT_MIN).

Execution:
Arrange: Set up the fizz_buzz function with the minimum value of an integer, e.g., INT_MIN
Act: Invoke the fizz_buzz function with the set up number
Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual results match the expected outcomes

Expected Output:
0 'None' strings

Validation:
In this scenario, we expect the function to return no output when given the minimum value of an integer (INT_MIN). We assert the outputs to ensure consistency and accuracy in the function's behavior. This test is important to verify that the function handles edge cases correctly.
