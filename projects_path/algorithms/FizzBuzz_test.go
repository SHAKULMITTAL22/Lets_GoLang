 Scenario 1: Testing Basic FizzBuzz Functionality

Details:
This test scenario checks if the function correctly identifies and prints numbers divisible by both 3 and 5 (FizzBuzz), as well as numbers divisible by either 3 (Fizz) or 5 (Buzz) within the specified range.

Execution:
Arrange: Set up a test function with the 'fizz_buzz' function and provide a range of numbers from 1 to 15.
Act: Invoke the 'fizz_buzz' function with the test range.
Assert: Verify the printed output for each number, checking for "FizzBuzz" at 15, "Fizz" at 3, 6, 9, 12 and "Buzz" at 5, 10.

Validation:
This test scenario ensures the correct output of the function for a series of numbers and validates its interaction with inputs from a given range. This is important to cover expected functionality and meet business requirements.

Scenario 2: Testing Edge Cases for Divisibility Criteria

Details:
This test scenario checks the function's behavior at the edge of divisibility criteria, specifically at 0, 1, multiples of 3, and multiples of 5.

Execution:
Arrange: Set up a test function with the 'fizz_buzz' function and provide a range of numbers from -5 to 20.
Act: Invoke the 'fizz_buzz' function with the test range.
Assert: Verify the printed output for each number, checking for "None" at 1, "Fizz" at 3 and 6, "Buzz" at 5 and 10, and "FizzBuzz" at 15. Additionally, verify that no output is generated for 0.

Validation:
This test verifies the function's edge case behavior when encountering inputs that are out of the standard range or at the boundary of divisibility criteria. This ensures that the function handles edge cases correctly, maintaining stability and consistency.

Scenario 3: Testing Large Range Input

Details:
This test scenario checks the function's behavior with a large range input that contains very large numbers.

Execution:
Arrange: Set up a test function with the 'fizz_buzz' function.
Act: Invoke the 'fizz_buzz' function with a large test range, from 1 to 1000.
Assert: Verify the printed output for the numbers in the large range, making sure that "Fizz", "Buzz", and "FizzBuzz" are printed correctly only for the corresponding numbers.

Validation:
This test scenario ensures that the function can process a large input range within reasonable execution time and handles divisibility checking correctly for large numbers. This aspect is essential to meet performance and scalability requirements.

Scenario 4: Testing Negative Range Input

Details:
This test scenario checks the function's behavior with negative numbers in the input range.

Execution:
Arrange: Set up a test function with the 'fizz_buzz' function.
Act: Invoke the 'fizz_buzz' function with a range that includes negative numbers, such as from -10 to 10.
Assert: Verify the printed output for the numbers in the range, making sure that no arithmetic errors occur for negative numbers and that divisibility checking is applied correctly to those numbers.

Validation:
This test scenario confirms the correct operation of the function with negative numbers, verifying the absence of arithmetic errors and ensuring that divisibility criteria are handled consistently for all input values. This feature is important to ensure correctness and compliance with domain constraints.

Scenario 5: Testing Zero Input

Details:
This test scenario checks the function's response when called with a zero input value.

Execution:
Arrange: Set up a test function with the 'fizz_buzz' function.
Act: Invoke the 'fizz_buzz' function just with zero input.
Assert: Verify that the function does not print any output for zero input.

Validation:
This test case confirms that the function handles zero as a special case and ensures that the function does not generate unnecessary output or enter infinite loops when confronted with a zero input value. This feature demonstrates the function's robustness and error-handling capabilities.
