ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=fizz_buzz_18fb1c9776

### Scenario 1: Positive Number Input
Details:
  Description: Test the function with a positive integer to ensure it prints the correct sequence of "Fizz", "Buzz", "FizzBuzz", or "None" for each number up to the input number minus one.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement since the function does not modify or depend on external data.
  Act: Call `fizz_buzz` with a positive integer, for example, 15.
  Assert: Capture the output of the function and verify that it contains the correct sequence of "Fizz", "Buzz", "FizzBuzz", and "None" corresponding to the rules defined in the function.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is to check the output sequence against a predefined string of expected results. This test confirms that the function behaves correctly under normal conditions and adheres to the FizzBuzz logic, which is crucial for verifying the function's core functionality.

### Scenario 2: Zero as Input
Details:
  Description: Test the function with zero as input to ensure it handles this edge case without errors and does not produce any output.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Call `fizz_buzz` with 0 as the argument.
  Assert: Ensure that no output is produced.
Validation:
  Asserting that no output is produced when input is zero is important as it verifies the function's ability to handle lower boundary conditions and confirms that the loop does not execute when not necessary.

### Scenario 3: Negative Number Input
Details:
  Description: Test the function with a negative integer to confirm that it handles such input gracefully, considering the loop should not execute.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Call `fizz_buzz` with a negative integer, e.g., -10.
  Assert: Confirm that no output is produced, indicating that the loop did not execute.
Validation:
  Asserting no output for negative input verifies the function's robustness in dealing with unexpected input values, ensuring that it does not behave erratically or produce incorrect results.

### Scenario 4: Large Number Input
Details:
  Description: Test the function with a very large number to assess performance and ensure it handles large loops without failure.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `fizz_buzz` with a large number, such as 10000.
  Assert: Monitor execution time and ensure it completes without errors.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for understanding the performance implications of the function under stress and ensures that there are no hidden issues like memory overflow or timeouts in processing large numbers.

### Scenario 5: Verify Console Output Formatting
Details:
  Description: Ensure that the output format strictly follows the "Fizz", "Buzz", "FizzBuzz", or "None" format, including correct handling of spaces and new lines.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `fizz_buzz` with a number like 15 and capture the console output.
  Assert: Check that each line in the output matches exactly "Fizz X", "Buzz X", "FizzBuzz X", or "None" where X is the number, and validate correct spacing and line breaks.
Validation:
  Precise output formatting is essential for the maintainability and readability of the output, particularly if other systems or users depend on this format for further processing or for understanding the results. This test ensures that the function adheres to the expected output standards.
