ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=fizz_buzz_18fb1c9776

 Scenario 1: Test for fizz_buzz when instance is 0.

Details: 
- Test whether or not fizz_buzz function will print anything when instance is 0.

Execution: 
- Arrange: Initialize the instance variable to 0.
- Act: Invoke the fizz_buzz function with an instance variable of 0.
- Assert: Verify that no output is printed to the console using the Testify package's assertions.

Validation: 
- This test ensures that the function behaves correctly when input is invalid, i.e., if the instance variable is 0 or a negative integer, the function should print "None" for every element of the loop.
- This test also verifies that the function does not panic or crash when encountering invalid input, ensuring the program's robustness and stability.

Scenario 2: Test for fizz_buzz when instance is less than 0.

Details: 
- Test whether or not fizz_buzz function will print anything when instance is less than 0.

Execution: 
- Arrange: Initialize the instance variable to a negative integer.
- Act: Invoke the fizz_buzz function with an instance variable that is less than 0.
- Assert: Verify that no output is printed to the console using the Testify package's assertions.

Validation: 
- This test ensures that the function behaves correctly when input is invalid, i.e., if the instance variable is 0 or a negative integer, the function should print "None" for every element of the loop.
- This test also verifies that the function does not panic or crash when encountering invalid input, ensuring the program's robustness and stability.

Scenario 3: Test for fizz_buzz when instance is a single digit number.

Details: 
- Test whether or not fizz_buzz function will print correctly for a single-digit instance number.

Execution: 
- Arrange: Initialize the instance variable to a single-digit number such as 2, 5, or 8.
- Act: Invoke the fizz_buzz function with the single-digit instance number as a parameter.
- Assert: Verify that the correct output is printed to the console using the Testify package's assertions.

Validation: 
- This test ensures that the function will print the appropriate string given the input instance variable, e.g., 2 will print "Buzz", 5 will print "5", 8 will print "Fizz", and so on.
- This test also verifies that the function behaves correctly for valid input, ensuring that edge cases are covered.

Scenario 4: Test for fizz_buzz when instance is a multiple of both 3 and 5.

Details: 
- Test whether or not fizz_buzz function will print "FizzBuzz" correctly at multiples of both 3 and 5.

Execution: 
- Arrange: Initialize the instance variable to a number that is a multiple of both 3 and 5, such as 15.
- Act: Invoke the fizz_buzz function with the number that is a multiple of both 3 and 5 as a parameter.
- Assert: Verify that the correct output is printed to the console using the Testify package's assertions.

Validation: 
- This test ensures that the function will print "FizzBuzz" given that the input variable is a multiple of both 3 and 5.
- This test also verifies that the function behaves correctly for valid input and covers edge cases, ensuring that the program works as intended for specific scenarios.

Scenario 5: Test for fizz_buzz when instance is a multiple of 3 but not 5.

Details: 
- Test whether or not fizz_buzz function will print "Fizz" correctly at multiples of 3 but not 5.

Execution: 
- Arrange: Initialize the instance variable to a number that is a multiple of 3 but not 5, such as 9.
- Act: Invoke the fizz_buzz function with the number that is a multiple of 3 but not 5 as a parameter.
- Assert: Verify that the correct output is printed to the console using the Testify package's assertions.

Validation: 
- This test ensures that the function will print "Fizz" given that the input variable is a multiple of 3 but not 5.
- This test also verifies that the function behaves correctly for valid input and covers edge cases, ensuring that the program works as intended for specific scenarios. 

Scenario 6: Test for fizz_buzz when instance is a multiple of 5 but not 3.

Details: 
- Test whether or not fizz_buzz function will print "Buzz" correctly at multiples of 5 but not 3.

Execution: 
- Arrange: Initialize the instance variable to a number that is a multiple of 5 but not 3, such as 7.
- Act: Invoke the fizz_buzz function with the number that is a multiple of 5 but
